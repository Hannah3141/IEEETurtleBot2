'''
As the robot drives through each square, mark it as travelled. We will know this based on data from /odom. 
Maybe we will need to relocalize at some point with lidar or just the laser (laser's topic is called /scan and there’s a video for it), -- this is what Kalman filters are for, https://github.com/kimsooyoung/kalman_filter_ros2_tutorial/blob/main/kalman_filter/kalman_filter/kalman_filter_solution.py
especially if the asteroids throw us off course, we’ll need to test it. 
First thing is to drop off our beacon if we have one, and we’ll get the aprilTag ID at the same time if we’re using it. 
Then we head straight for the cave, no matter how many asteroids we do or don’t have 
(ideally we could dump some on the way if we are reliable enough, but i don’t think we will be). 
As soon as we touch that square inside the cave, we can go back and dump whatever geodinium we’ve collected into the close CSC. 
Let’s see how many asteroids our robot can hold, how long we can drive around in the cave, hopefully even outside it, before we have to go dump again. 
Maybe we could do a fancy math equation and calculate how much time we have left vs how far we currently are from the rendezvous pads 
to decide when exactly we need to leave to move the CSCs, but probably by the last 30 seconds (endgame anyone??? lol)
